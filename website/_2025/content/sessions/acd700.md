This talk explores approaches to managing and provisioning dynamic infrastructure for cell-based SaaS application, where each tenant requires dedicated resources due to security requirements, or gradual migration from silo based deployment.

Main focus areas include common resources for most SaaS applications, such as secrets backed by AWS Secrets Manager & KMS, database clusters backed by Amazon Aurora or S3 buckets. There will be examples and lessons learned throughout Ataccamaâ€™s year journey of creating a new SaaS, which is now in production.
