2024 has been the year of taking generative AI applications into production. Launching generative AI applications requires careful considerations around model selection and evaluations, fine-tuning versus RAG, security, privacy, hallucination control, and cost management. In this session, dive into some common architecture patterns, security guardrails, governance approaches, and optimization tricks that have been developed to support hundreds of AWS customers launch their generative AI workloads in production globally across popular use cases, like content generation, chatbots, document search, and more.
