In today's cloud-native world, treating infrastructure as code isn't just a best practiceâ€”it's a necessity. While YAML-based tools have served us well, they often fall short when dealing with complex, enterprise-scale infrastructure. The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) bridges this gap by bringing software engineering principles to infrastructure deployment.

This session introduces AWS CDK as a powerful alternative to traditional IaC approaches, demonstrating how it enables teams to leverage familiar programming concepts while maintaining infrastructure consistency and reliability. We'll explore how CDK's programming model accelerates development cycles and reduces common infrastructure deployment pitfalls.

Key Takeaways:

* Understanding CDK's core concepts and how they differ from traditional IaC tools
* Best practices for structuring CDK applications in enterprise environments
* Leveraging CDK constructs to implement security and compliance requirements
* Techniques for testing and validating infrastructure code
* Strategies for transitioning teams from CloudFormation/Terraform to CDK
