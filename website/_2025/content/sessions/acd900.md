AI isn’t replacing developers—it’s redefining their role. In this fast-paced 15-minute talk, we’ll explore how tools like AWS Bedrock for Agents are transforming coding into orchestration, and developers into architects and problem-solvers. Say goodbye to the 8-hour console grind and hello to workflows where AI handles the mundane.

Packed with real-world lessons (and a few funny AI fails), you’ll learn how to thrive in this new era—where the smartest developers aren’t writing more code, but guiding AI to do it for them.
