Event-Driven Architecture sounds great in theory, but how does it work in production? In this session, I'll show you how we implement EventBridge in the real world, using practical examples from a blogging platform.

We'll explore key architectural decisions like the subscription pattern and how to structure your events properly. Then we'll get hands-on with TypeScript and CDK, covering event validation with zod and middy, error handling patterns, and implementing idempotency. All examples will be based on actual production code that you can adapt for your own projects.
