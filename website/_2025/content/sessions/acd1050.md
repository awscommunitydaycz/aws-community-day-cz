This talk showcases how Stormit, as an AWS Advanced Partner, designed and delivered a scalable, event-driven data platform for a fast-growing biotech startup. Leveraging AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, SQS, Lambda, Kinesis Data Firehose) and Snowflakeâ€™s Snowpipe, we automated data pipelines for multiple log types and analytics. Attendees will learn how to architect modern, serverless data pipelines, automate data ingestion and transformation.
