More and more companies are adopting serverless technologies as the community is defining the best practices, tools, and patterns.

Companies using Terraform as their infrastructure as a code tool are often required to reinvent the wheel when they work with serverless.

In the talk, I will explain why managing serverless applications with Terraform is a good idea and how [serverless.tf](https://serverless.tf) open-source project has started as an organic response to the accidental complexity of many existing tools used by serverless developers.

I will demo a complete serverless application (including building and deploying it) using Terraform and open-source components.
