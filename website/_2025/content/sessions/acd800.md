Our Monitoring Journey: From Chaos to Nirvana

Alex Gain shares the evolution of his team’s monitoring setup — from manual chaos to a fully automated, GitOps-driven system managing dozens of Kubernetes clusters. The talk covers key transitions: early Terraform-based IaC, adoption of ArgoCD and ApplicationSets, and future plans with Crossplane. Packed with lessons on scaling observability, reducing engineer toil, and building resilient, client-agnostic monitoring platforms.
