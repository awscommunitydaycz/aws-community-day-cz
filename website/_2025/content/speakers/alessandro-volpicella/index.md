Hi üëãüèΩ

I'm Sandro, a fullstack developer specialized in AWS & Serverless. I love building digital projects that solve real problems.

Over the past few years, I've launched everything from weekend side projects to high-scale APIs handling 100 million monthly requests. I love building digital products, see [my projects](https://sandrovolpicella.com/projects)!

I work as a freelance developer & consultant. If you need help with your web application or want to improve your Cloud Infrastructure, reach out, and let's chat about how I can help.

I've published two AWS books: [AWS Fundamentals](https://awsfundamentals.com/) & the [CloudWatch Book](https://cloudwatchbook.com/) I believe you truly learn technology by applying it, not just studying for certifications. I focus on that in my content.

Always up for a coffee and a good tech conversation. Let's connect! ‚òï
