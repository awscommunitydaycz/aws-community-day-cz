I'm a Data Scientist with a strong background in Mathematics and Statistics. My main areas of expertise are machine learning and deep learning, with a special focus on Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI.

In the field of Computer Vision, I've played a major role in creating a product that uses deep-learning models for medical image classification. This project included working on multiple models, developing an API for results, and interacting directly with medical experts. I also have experience in text extraction from scanned documents across multiple languages. I've worked on optimizing runtime for this large-scale project, leading to cost savings on AWS.

On the NLP side, I've built a tool for summarizing and identifying links between knowledge and skills from educational course descriptions for a US startup. I've also created custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to extract different types of metadata from PDF documents, deploying these models on AWS Sagemaker.

Lately, I have participated in multiple projects leveraging LLMs. I have developed RAG production systems as well as autonomous agents.

I enjoy problem-solving, finding efficient ways to use technology, and always aim to achieve meaningful results. I'm interested in opportunities that challenge me to expand what's possible with data and technology.
